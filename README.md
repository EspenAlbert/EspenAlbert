- break% is `break_time` / `total_hours`, where break_time is going to the bathroom, pomodoro break, quick snack, coffee, etc.
- deep_{life/work}% are inspired by [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/) where I track time either as _deep_ (focused work, e.g., coding, design writing, research, etc.) or _shallow_ (virtual meeting with many participants, slack chats, email replying, etc.)
- overtime is whatever `work_hours - 7.5` per day and aggregated per Δ week
- life_hours are side projects involving coding
- life_days are days where life_hours > 0
