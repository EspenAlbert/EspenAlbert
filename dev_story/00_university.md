## Inspiration for programming
Seeing my cousin playing StarCraft was the initial factor that drew my interest towards computers around the year 2000.

Then, after many years of gaming, I got introduced to programming by taking a college course (IT-2) in 2010. Immediately I was fascinated and excelled quickly; therefore, I applied for a five years' computer science degree at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/).

## University
After serving a year in the military, I was ready and started my university studies in the fall of 2012.
The **first year** was challenging and I got my lowest grades in the programming courses despite having those as my favourites (maybe due to exams being on paper?).
Therefore, I made a deal with myself that if my grades didn't improve during my second year, I would quit.

During the **second year** the master program turned away from the "heavier" math courses and more into programming courses. By following a strict routine of only studying 6 hours a day Mon-Fri my grades improved and I felt like I was on the right track.
<br />
However, by the end of the second year, I didn't feel like a programmer at all.
I programmed entirely in python and java and possessed only beginner skills with object-oriented design, algorithms, and data structures.
Despite my incompetence, I was lucky to get a part-time job at [Unit4 Current Software](http://www.unit4.com/no/om-unit4/agresso-current-unit4).
<br />
Although translating test cases and testing didn't involve much programming, this job was critical for my development as a software engineer.
Firstly, it introduced me to the workflow of a mature software company.
Secondly, it made every course at university more practical since I could see the abstract concepts in practice, e.g., agile development process.
<br />Thirdly, I got mentors for programming which gave a significant boost by introducing programming principles like [SRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and [KISS.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)

The **third year** of the university gave me more freedom to select courses.
My strategy always involved picking the "programy" courses with coursework instead of the theory-based courses and stay at a high abstraction level (avoid assembly programming).
<br />
Therefore, I chose AI as the main direction of my studies.
This year I finally felt like I was learning to become a better programmer full time. Both the courses at school and my part-time job, which now included automatizing testing cases with selenium required many hours of programming.
<br />
Software architecture during the 2nd term became my favourite course throughout my entire studies. It had a big project creating a multiplayer game and introduced many design principles.

Singapore was my place of origin during my **fourth year**.
It was two intense semesters: 11 courses instead of 8 courses in 2x12 weeks of lectures.
And although I didn't like the testing system (short time and many algorithmic calculations instead of understanding and explaining), I performed well.
This proved that my focused work hours and study techniques worked across universities.
However, despite achieving good grades, a fellow local student made it clear that I lacked skills for sharing my programs with the world.
<br />
He impressed me by creating and publishing a website for annotating comments during a sentiment analysis project.
This convinced me that I needed to start thinking of how to use the web, and I picked enterprise application development as a course for my 2nd term.
Although I never use JavaEE 6 and [JSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Faces) anymore, this course proved valuable to learn about building and publishing websites.

Finally, reaching my **fifth year** and final year of my studies, I decided to pick a project assignment which focused on linked data.
I wanted something new to learn and to be part of a bigger project which focused on providing technology for helping newspapers, e.g. by recommending news articles.
<br />
Looking back now, I regret taking this project assignment.
Learning wise it was probably one of the best terms, but instead of further developing my skills in AI, I ended up with less relevant skills (how to use linked data).
So if I had the chance to go back, I would choose an assignment focused around a Kaggle competition (like one of my courses in Singapore).
This would have given me more time to use machine learning in practice, and more familiarity with deep learning, a great but time-constrained course during my 1st term.


### Final year university and transitioning to working life ###
Starting my final year, I thought about the transition into working life.
Podcasts, books, and courses on entrepreneurship made me want to start a company.
<br /> During the 1st semester I talked to some classmates about starting a company focused on the hype words: big data, AI, machine learning, etc.
<br /> In the 2nd term me and three classmates started this process.
However, time constraints and a *knowledge gap* made the process slow, and we never managed to get any paid projects.
The knowledge gap was what I had seen from my Singaporean friend the year before: I didn't have the necessary skills to use the web.
So starting in the Christmas break between the two semesters in late 2016 I began my journey into web development.

Except for the final weeks of my master thesis, I spent 50% of my time learning web development.
In addition to using youtube, I went through a whole series of online courses from Udacity, Coursera, Pluralsight, and Udemy.
Although this hurt my master thesis, I don't regret the decision.
The newly acquired skills in web development helped me get a job in Rocketfarm at the end of my studies.
<br />
I chose [Rocketfarm](https://www.rocketfarm.no/) because of its small size and developer freedom.
They have practically no standards on selecting software, and the small size makes it vital to learn new skills.
