# Commit Stats
- Purpose: Track weekly key metrics across Github/Gitlab/AzureDevOps to see how I spend my time and how much I am contributing
- How: Every Monday morning I run the script that scans all my git repositories and counts the stats I care about. E.g. LoC, python packages, dockerfiles created, 3rd-party packages, etc.
- Extensions:
  - Toggl hours: Download the weekly time entries and summarize how many days I have worked, how many days I have worked on private projects, deep/shallow ratio, vacation days this year, and public holidays

## How it works?
- I hope to open source the CLI when it becomes more mature
